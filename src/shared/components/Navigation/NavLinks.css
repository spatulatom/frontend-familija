/* somewhat these link remain active after they have been clicked, 
 but acctually at the bottom we have .nav-links a.active, not :active
 /* but .active, dont see that class and it might be of a thing for 
 Navlink component that is imported from react-route-dom*/ 
 /* Basically NavLink is a component that 'knows' whether or 
 not it is currently an acitive link;
 what does it mean 'knows' and how that looks in vanilla js pages?
  so in vanilla js pages 'to know' we need a speciall function
  that adds event listeners to all links and then when link is 
  clicked id adds active class to it (and removes avtive from other link)
  -this is how it knows,
  in here Navlink does it for us so it basically must listen 
  for click and thrn add 'acive' class to cliced NavLink and 
  removes 'active' it from any other NavLink  */
